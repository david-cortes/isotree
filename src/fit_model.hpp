/*  Fit Isolation Forest model, or variant of it such as SCiForest
* 
* Parameters:
* ===========
* - model_outputs (out)
*       Pointer to already allocated isolation forest model object for single-variable splits.
*       If fitting the extended model, pass NULL (must pass 'model_outputs_ext'). Can later add
*       additional trees through function 'add_tree'.
* - model_outputs_ext (out)
*       Pointer to already allocated extended isolation forest model object (for multiple-variable splits).
*       Note that if 'ndim' = 1, must use instead the single-variable model object.
*       If fitting the single-variable model, pass NULL (must pass 'model_outputs'). Can later add
*       additional trees through function 'add_tree'.
* - numeric_data[nrows * ncols_numeric]
*       Pointer to numeric data to which to fit the model. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no dense numeric columns (must also pass 'ncols_numeric' = 0 if there's
*       no sparse numeric data either).
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
* - ncols_numeric
*       Number of numeric columns in the data (whether they come in a sparse matrix or dense array).
* - categ_data[nrows * ncols_categ]
*       Pointer to categorical data to which to fit the model. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no categorical columns (must also pass 'ncols_categ' = 0).
*       Each category should be represented as an integer, and these integers must start at zero and
*       be in consecutive order - i.e. if category '3' is present, category '2' must also be present
*       (note that they are not treated as being ordinal, this is just an encoding). Missing values
*       should be encoded as negative numbers such as (-1).
* - ncols_categ
*       Number of categorical columns in the data.
* - ncat[ncols_categ]
*       Number of categories in each categorical column. E.g. if the highest code for a column is '4',
*       the number of categories for that column is '5' (zero is one category).
* - Xc[nnz]
*       Pointer to numeric data in sparse numeric matrix in CSC format (column-compressed).
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
* - Xc_ind[nnz]
*       Pointer to row indices to which each non-zero entry in 'Xc' corresponds.
*       Must be in sorted order, otherwise results will be incorrect.
*       The largest value here should be smaller than the largest possible value of 'size_t'.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - Xc_indptr[ncols_numeric + 1]
*       Pointer to column index pointers that tell at entry [col] where does column 'col'
*       start and at entry [col + 1] where does column 'col' end.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - ndim
*       How many dimensions (columns) to use for making a split. Must pass 'ndim' = 1 for
*       the single-variable model. Note that the model object pointer passed must also
*       agree with the value passed to 'ndim'.
* - ntry
*       When using any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_full_gain', 'prob_pick_by_dens', how many variables (with 'ndim=1')
*       or linear combinations (with 'ndim>1') to try for determining the best one according to gain.
*       Recommended value in reference [4] is 10 (with 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', for outlier detection), while the
*       recommended value in reference [11] is 1 (with 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', for outlier detection), and the
*       recommended value in reference [9] is 10 to 20 (with 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', for missing value imputations).
* - coef_type
*       For the extended model, whether to sample random coefficients according to a normal distribution ~ N(0, 1)
*       (as proposed in [4]) or according to a uniform distribution ~ Unif(-1, +1) as proposed in [3]. Ignored for the
*       single-variable model.
* - sample_weights[nrows]
*       Weights for the rows when building a tree, either as sampling importances when using
*       sub-samples for each tree (i.e. passing weight '2' makes a row twice as likely to be included
*       in a random sub-sample), or as density measurement (i.e. passing weight '2' is the same as if
*       the row appeared twice, thus it's less of an outlier) - how this is taken is determined
*       through parameter 'weight_as_sample'.
*       Pass NULL if the rows all have uniform weights.
* - with_replacement
*       Whether to sample rows with replacement or not (not recommended). Note that distance calculations,
*       if desired, don't work well with duplicate rows.
* - weight_as_sample
*       If passing sample (row) weights when fitting the model, whether to consider those weights as row
*       sampling weights (i.e. the higher the weights, the more likely the observation will end up included
*       in each tree sub-sample), or as distribution density weights (i.e. putting a weight of two is the same
*       as if the row appeared twice, thus higher weight makes it less of an outlier, but does not give it a
*       higher chance of being sampled if the data uses sub-sampling).
* - nrows
*       Number of rows in 'numeric_data', 'Xc', 'categ_data'.
* - sample_size
*       Sample size of the data sub-samples with which each binary tree will be built. When a terminal node has more than
*       1 observation, the remaining isolation depth for them is estimated assuming the data and splits are both uniformly
*       random (separation depth follows a similar process with expected value calculated as in [6]). If passing zero,
*       will set it to 'nrows'. Recommended value in [1], [2], [3] is 256, while the default value in the author's code
*       in [5] is 'nrows' here.
* - ntrees
*       Number of binary trees to build for the model. Recommended value in [1] is 100, while the default value in the
*       author's code in [5] is 10.
* - max_depth
*       Maximum depth of the binary trees to grow. Will get overwritten if passing 'limit_depth' = 'true'.
*       Models that use 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl' or 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg' are likely to benefit from
*       deeper trees (larger 'max_depth'), but deeper trees can result in much slower model fitting and
*       predictions.
*       Note that models that use 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl' or 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg' are likely to benefit from
*       deeper trees (larger 'max_depth'), but deeper trees can result in much slower model fitting and
*       predictions.
*       If using pooled gain, one might want to substitute 'max_depth' with 'min_gain'.
* - ncols_per_tree
*       Number of columns to use (have as potential candidates for splitting at each iteration) in each tree,
*       similar to the 'mtry' parameter of random forests.
*       In general, this is only relevant when using non-random splits and/or weighted column choices.
*       If passing zero, will use the full number of available columns.
*       Recommended value: 0.
* - limit_depth
*       Whether to automatically set the maximum depth to the corresponding depth of a balanced binary tree with number of
*       terminal nodes corresponding to the sub-sample size (the reason being that, if trying to detect outliers, an outlier
*       will only be so if it turns out to be isolated with shorter average depth than usual, which corresponds to a balanced
*       tree depth). Default setting for [1], [2], [3], [4] is 'true', but it's recommended to pass 'false' here
*       and higher values for 'max_depth' if using the model for purposes other than outlier detection.
*       Note that, if passing 'limit_depth=true', then 'max_depth' is ignored.
* - penalize_range
*       Whether to penalize (add -1 to the terminal depth) observations at prediction time that have a value
*       of the chosen split variable (linear combination in extended model) that falls outside of a pre-determined
*       reasonable range in the data being split (given by 2 * range in data and centered around the split point),
*       as proposed in [4] and implemented in the authors' original code in [5]. Not used in single-variable model
*       when splitting by categorical variables. Note that this can make a very large difference in the results
*       when using 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl'.
*       This option is not supported when using density-based outlier scoring metrics.
* - standardize_data
*       Whether to standardize the features at each node before creating a linear combination of them as suggested
*       in [4]. This is ignored when using 'ndim=1'.
* - scoring_metric
*       Metric to use for determining outlier scores (see reference [13]).
*       If passing 'Depth', will use isolation depth as proposed in reference [1]. This is typically the safest choice
*       and plays well with all model types offered by this library.
*       If passing 'Density', will set scores for each terminal node as the ratio between the fraction of points in the sub-sample
*       that end up in that node and the fraction of the volume in the feature space which defines
*       the node according to the splits that lead to it.
*       If using 'ndim=1', for categorical variables, 'Density' is defined in terms
*       of number of categories that go towards each side of the split divided by number of categories
*       in the observations that reached that node.
*       The standardized outlier score from 'Density' for a given observation is calculated as the
*       negative of the logarithm of the geometric mean from the per-tree densities, which unlike
*       the standardized score produced from 'Depth', is unbounded, but just like the standardized
*       score form 'Depth', has a natural threshold for defining outlierness, which in this case
*       is zero is instead of 0.5. The non-standardized outlier score for 'Density' is calculated as the
*       geometric mean, while the per-tree scores are calculated as the density values.
*       'Density' might lead to better predictions when using 'ndim=1', particularly in the presence
*       of categorical variables. Note however that using 'Density' requires more trees for convergence
*       of scores (i.e. good results) compared to isolation-based metrics.
*       'Density' is incompatible with 'penalize_range=true'.
*       If passing 'AdjDepth', will use an adjusted isolation depth that takes into account the number of points that
*       go to each side of a given split vs. the fraction of the range of that feature that each
*       side of the split occupies, by a metric as follows: 'd = 2/ (1 + 1/(2*p))'
*       where 'p' is defined as 'p = (n_s / n_t) / (r_s / r_t)
*       with 'n_t' being the number of points that reach a given node, 'n_s' the
*       number of points that are sent to a given side of the split/branch at that node,
*       'r_t' being the range (maximum minus minimum) of the splitting feature or
*       linear combination among the points that reached the node, and 'r_s' being the
*       range of the same feature or linear combination among the points that are sent to this
*       same side of the split/branch. This makes each split add a number between zero and two
*       to the isolation depth, with this number's probabilistic distribution being centered
*       around 1 and thus the expected isolation depth remains the same as in the original
*       'Depth' metric, but having more variability around the extremes.
*       Scores (standardized, non-standardized, per-tree) for 'AdjDepth' are aggregated in the same way
*       as for 'Depth'.
*       'AdjDepth' might lead to better predictions when using 'ndim=1', particularly in the presence
*       of categorical variables and for smaller datasets, and for smaller datasets, might make
*       sense to combine it with 'penalize_range=true'.
*       If passing 'AdjDensity', will use the same metric from 'AdjDepth', but applied multiplicatively instead
*       of additively. The expected value for 'AdjDepth' is not strictly the same
*       as for isolation, but using the expected isolation depth as standardizing criterion
*       tends to produce similar standardized score distributions (centered around 0.5).
*       Scores (standardized, non-standardized, per-tree) from 'AdjDensity' are aggregated in the same way
*       as for 'Depth'.
*       'AdjDepth' is incompatible with 'penalize_range=true'.
*       If passing 'BoxedRatio', will set the scores for each terminal node as the ratio between the volume of the boxed
*       feature space for the node as defined by the smallest and largest values from the split
*       conditions for each column (bounded by the variable ranges in the sample) and the
*       variable ranges in the tree sample.
*       If using 'ndim=1', for categorical variables 'BoxedRatio' is defined in terms of number of categories.
*       If using 'ndim=>1', 'BoxedRatio' is defined in terms of the maximum achievable value for the
*       splitting linear combination determined from the minimum and maximum values for each
*       variable among the points in the sample, and as such, it has a rather different meaning
*       compared to the score obtained with 'ndim=1' - 'BoxedRatio' scores with 'ndim>1'
*       typically provide very poor quality results and this metric is thus not recommended to
*       use in the extended model. With 'ndim>1', 'BoxedRatio' also has a tendency of producing too small
*       values which round to zero.
*       The standardized outlier score from 'BoxedRatio' for a given observation is calculated
*       simply as the the average from the per-tree boxed ratios. 'BoxedRatio' metric
*       has a lower bound of zero and a theoretical upper bound of one, but in practice the scores
*       tend to be very small numbers close to zero, and its distribution across
*       different datasets is rather unpredictable. In order to keep rankings comparable with
*       the rest of the metrics, the non-standardized outlier scores for 'BoxedRatio' are calculated as the
*       negative of the average instead. The per-tree 'BoxedRatio' scores are calculated as the ratios.
*       'BoxedRatio' can be calculated in a fast-but-not-so-precise way, and in a low-but-precise
*       way, which is controlled by parameter 'fast_bratio'. Usually, both should give the
*       same results, but in some fatasets, the fast way can lead to numerical inaccuracies
*       due to roundoffs very close to zero.
*       'BoxedRatio' might lead to better predictions in datasets with many rows when using 'ndim=1'
*       and a relatively small 'sample_size'. Note that more trees are required for convergence
*       of scores when using 'BoxedRatio'. In some datasets, 'BoxedRatio' metric might result in very bad
*       predictions, to the point that taking its inverse produces a much better ranking of outliers.
*       'BoxedRatio' option is incompatible with 'penalize_range'.
*       If passing 'BoxedDensity2', will set the score as the ratio between the fraction of points within the sample that
*       end up in a given terminal node and the 'BoxedRatio' metric.
*       Aggregation of scores (standardized, non-standardized, per-tree) for 'BoxedDensity2' is done in the same
*       way as for 'Density', and it also has a natural threshold at zero for determining
*       outliers and inliers.
*       'BoxedDensity2' is typically usable with 'ndim>1', but tends to produce much bigger values
*       compared to 'ndim=1'.
*       Albeit unintuitively, in many datasets, one can usually get better results with metric
*       'BoxedDensity' instead.
*       The calculation of 'BoxedDensity2' is also controlled by 'fast_bratio'.
*       'BoxedDensity2' incompatible with 'penalize_range'.
*       If passing 'BoxedDensity', will set the score as the ratio between the fraction of points within the sample that
*       end up in a  given terminal node and the ratio between the boxed volume of the feature
*       space in the sample and the boxed volume of a node given by the split conditions (inverse
*       as in 'BoxedDensity2'). This metric does not have any theoretical or intuitive
*       justification behind its existence, and it is perhaps illogical to use it as a
*       scoring metric, but tends to produce good results in some datasets.
*       The standardized outlier scores for 'BoxedDensity' are defined as the negative of the geometric mean,
*       while the non-standardized scores are the geometric mean, and the per-tree scores are simply the 'density' values.
*       The calculation of 'BoxedDensity' is also controlled by 'fast_bratio'.
*       'BoxedDensity' option is incompatible with 'penalize_range'.
* - fast_bratio
*       When using "boxed" metrics for scoring, whether to calculate them in a fast way through
*       cumulative sum of logarithms of ratios after each split, or in a slower way as sum of
*       logarithms of a single ratio per column for each terminal node.
*       Usually, both methods should give the same results, but in some datasets, particularly
*       when variables have too small or too large ranges, the first method can be prone to
*       numerical inaccuracies due to roundoff close to zero.
*       Note that this does not affect calculations for models with 'ndim>1', since given the
*       split types, the calculation for them is different.
* - standardize_dist
*       If passing 'tmat' (see documentation for it), whether to standardize the resulting average separation
*       depths in order to produce a distance metric or not, in the same way this is done for the outlier score.
* - tmat[nrows * (nrows - 1) / 2]
*       Array in which to calculate average separation depths or standardized distance metric (see documentation
*       for 'standardize_dist') as the model is being fit. Pass NULL to avoid doing these calculations alongside
*       the regular model process. If passing this output argument, the sample size must be the same as the number
*       of rows, and there cannot be sample weights. If not NULL, must already be initialized to zeros. As the
*       output is a symmetric matrix, this function will only fill in the upper-triangular part, in which
*       entry 0 <= i < j < n will be located at position
*           p(i,j) = (i * (n - (i+1)/2) + j - i - 1).
*       Can be converted to a dense square matrix through function 'tmat_to_dense'.
* - output_depths[nrows]
*       Array in which to calculate average path depths or standardized outlierness metric (see documentation
*       for 'standardize_depth') as the model is being fit. Pass NULL to avoid doing these calculations alongside
*       the regular model process. If passing this output argument, the sample size must be the same as the number
*       of rows. If not NULL, must already be initialized to zeros.
* - standardize_depth
*       If passing 'output_depths', whether to standardize the results as proposed in [1], in order to obtain
*       a metric in which the more outlier is an observation, the closer this standardized metric will be to 1,
*       with average observations obtaining 0.5. If passing 'false' here, the numbers in 'output_depths' will be
*       the average depth of each row across all trees.
* - col_weights[ncols_numeric + ncols_categ]
*       Sampling weights for each column, assuming all the numeric columns come before the categorical columns.
*       Ignored when picking columns by deterministic criterion.
*       If passing NULL, each column will have a uniform weight. If used along with kurtosis weights, the
*       effect is multiplicative.
* - weigh_by_kurt
*       Whether to weigh each column according to the kurtosis obtained in the sub-sample that is selected
*       for each tree as briefly proposed in [1]. Note that this is only done at the beginning of each tree
*       sample. For categorical columns, will calculate expected kurtosis if the column were converted to
*       numerical by assigning to each category a random number ~ Unif(0, 1).
*       This is intended as a cheap feature selector, while the parameter 'prob_pick_col_by_kurt'
*       provides the option to do this at each node in the tree for a different overall type of model.
*       If passing column weights or weighted column choices ('prob_pick_col_by_range', 'prob_pick_col_by_var'),
*       the effect will be multiplicative. This option is not compatible with 'prob_pick_col_by_kurt'.
*       If passing 'missing_action=fail' and the data has infinite values, columns with rows
*       having infinite values will get a weight of zero. If passing a different value for missing
*       action, infinite values will be ignored in the kurtosis calculation.
*       If using 'missing_action=Impute', the calculation of kurtosis will not use imputed values
*       in order not to favor columns with missing values (which would increase kurtosis by all having
*       the same central value).
* - prob_pick_by_gain_pl
*       This parameter indicates the probability of choosing the threshold on which to split a variable
*       (with 'ndim=1') or a linear combination of variables (when using 'ndim>1') as the threshold
*       that maximizes a pooled standard deviation gain criterion (see references [9] and [11]) on the
*       same variable or linear combination, similarly to regression trees such as CART.
*       If using 'ntry>1', will try several variables or linear combinations thereof and choose the one
*       in which the largest standardized gain can be achieved.
*       For categorical variables with 'ndim=1', will use shannon entropy instead (like in [7]).
*       Compared to a simple averaged gain, this tends to result in more evenly-divided splits and more clustered
*       groups when they are smaller. Recommended to pass higher values when used for imputation of missing values.
*       When used for outlier detection, datasets with multimodal distributions usually see better performance
*       under this type of splits.
*       Note that, since this makes the trees more even and thus it takes more steps to produce isolated nodes,
*       the resulting object will be heavier. When splits are not made according to any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg',
*       'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', 'prob_pick_by_full_gain', 'prob_pick_by_dens', both the column and the split point are decided at random.
*       Note that, if passing value 1 (100%) with no sub-sampling and using the single-variable model,
*       every single tree will have the exact same splits.
*       Be aware that 'penalize_range' can also have a large impact when using 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl'.
*       Be aware also that, if passing a value of 1 (100%) with no sub-sampling and using the single-variable
*       model, every single tree will have the exact same splits.
*       Under this option, models are likely to produce better results when increasing 'max_depth'.
*       Alternatively, one can also control the depth through 'min_gain' (for which one might want to
*       set 'max_depth=0').
*       Important detail: if using any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl', 'prob_pick_by_full_gain',
*       'prob_pick_by_dens', the distribution of outlier scores is unlikely to be centered around 0.5.
* - prob_pick_by_gain_avg
*       This parameter indicates the probability of choosing the threshold on which to split a variable
*       (with 'ndim=1') or a linear combination of variables (when using 'ndim>1') as the threshold
*       that maximizes an averaged standard deviation gain criterion (see references [4] and [11]) on the
*       same variable or linear combination.
*       If using 'ntry>1', will try several variables or linear combinations thereof and choose the one
*       in which the largest standardized gain can be achieved.
*       For categorical variables with 'ndim=1', will take the expected standard deviation that would be
*       gotten if the column were converted to numerical by assigning to each category a random
*       number ~ Unif(0, 1) and calculate gain with those assumed standard deviations.
*       Compared to a pooled gain, this tends to result in more cases in which a single observation or very
*       few of them are put into one branch. Typically, datasets with outliers defined by extreme values in
*       some column more or less independently of the rest, usually see better performance under this type
*       of split. Recommended to use sub-samples (parameter 'sample_size') when
*       passing this parameter. Note that, since this will create isolated nodes faster, the resulting object
*       will be lighter (use less memory).
*       When splits are not made according to any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl',
*       'prob_pick_by_full_gain', 'prob_pick_by_dens', both the column and the split point are decided at random.
*       Default setting for [1], [2], [3] is zero, and default for [4] is 1.
*       This is the randomization parameter that can be passed to the author's original code in [5],
*       but note that the code in [5] suffers from a mathematical error in the calculation of running standard deviations,
*       so the results from it might not match with this library's.
*       Be aware that, if passing a value of 1 (100%) with no sub-sampling and using the single-variable model,
*       every single tree will have the exact same splits.
*       Under this option, models are likely to produce better results when increasing 'max_depth'.
*       Important detail: if using any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl',
*       'prob_pick_by_full_gain', 'prob_pick_by_dens', the distribution of outlier scores is unlikely to be centered around 0.5.
* - prob_pick_by_full_gain
*       This parameter indicates the probability of choosing the threshold on which to split a variable
*       (with 'ndim=1') or a linear combination of variables (when using 'ndim>1') as the threshold
*       that minimizes the pooled sums of variances of all columns (or a subset of them if using
*       'ncols_per_tree').
*       In general, 'prob_pick_by_full_gain' is much slower to evaluate than the other gain types, and does not tend to
*       lead to better results. When using 'prob_pick_by_full_gain', one might want to use a different scoring
*       metric (particulatly 'Density', 'BoxedDensity2' or 'BoxedRatio'). Note that
*       the variance calculations are all done through the (exact) sorted-indices approach, while is much
*       slower than the (approximate) histogram approach used by other decision tree software.
*       Be aware that the data is not standardized in any way for the range calculations, thus the scales
*       of features will make a large difference under 'prob_pick_by_full_gain', which might not make it suitable for
*       all types of data.
*       'prob_pick_by_full_gain' is not compatible with categorical data, and 'min_gain' does not apply to it.
*       When splits are not made according to any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl',
*       'prob_pick_by_full_gain', 'prob_pick_by_dens', both the column and the split point are decided at random.
*       Default setting for [1], [2], [3], [4] is zero.
* - prob_pick_dens
*       This parameter indicates the probability of choosing the threshold on which to split a variable
*       (with 'ndim=1') or a linear combination of variables (when using 'ndim>1') as the threshold
*       that maximizes the pooled densities of the branch distributions.
*       The 'min_gain' option does not apply to this type of splits.
*       When splits are not made according to any of 'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', 'prob_pick_by_gain_pl',
*       'prob_pick_by_full_gain', 'prob_pick_by_dens', both the column and the split point are decided at random.
*       Default setting for [1], [2], [3], [4] is zero.
* - prob_pick_col_by_range
*       When using 'ndim=1', this denotes the probability of choosing the column to split with a probability
*       proportional to the range spanned by each column within a node as proposed in reference [12].
*       When using 'ndim>1', this denotes the probability of choosing columns to create a hyperplane with a
*       probability proportional to the range spanned by each column within a node.
*       This option is not compatible with categorical data. If passing column weights, the
*       effect will be multiplicative.
*       Be aware that the data is not standardized in any way for the range calculations, thus the scales
*       of features will make a large difference under this option, which might not make it suitable for
*       all types of data.
*       Note that the proposed RRCF model from [12] uses a different scoring metric for producing anomaly
*       scores, while this library uses isolation depth regardless of how columns are chosen, thus results
*       are likely to be different from those of other software implementations. Nevertheless, as explored
*       in [11], isolation depth as a scoring metric typically provides better results than the
*       "co-displacement" metric from [12] under these split types.
* - prob_pick_col_by_var
*       When using 'ndim=1', this denotes the probability of choosing the column to split with a probability
*       proportional to the variance of each column within a node.
*       When using 'ndim>1', this denotes the probability of choosing columns to create a hyperplane with a
*       probability proportional to the variance of each column within a node.
*       For categorical data, it will calculate the expected variance if the column were converted to
*       numerical by assigning to each category a random number ~ Unif(0, 1), which depending on the number of
*       categories and their distribution, produces numbers typically a bit smaller than standardized numerical
*       variables.
*       Note that when using sparse matrices, the calculation of variance will rely on a procedure that
*       uses sums of squares, which has less numerical precision than the
*       calculation used for dense inputs, and as such, the results might differ slightly.
*       Be aware that this calculated variance is not standardized in any way, so the scales of
*       features will make a large difference under this option.
*       If there are infinite values, all columns having infinite values will be treated as having the
*       same weight, and will be chosen before every other column with non-infinite values.
*       If passing column weights , the effect will be multiplicative.
*       If passing a 'missing_action' different than 'fail', infinite values will be ignored for the
*       variance calculation. Otherwise, all columns with infinite values will have the same probability
*       and will be chosen before columns with non-infinite values.
* - prob_pick_col_by_kurt
*       When using 'ndim=1', this denotes the probability of choosing the column to split with a probability
*       proportional to the kurtosis of each column **within a node** (unlike the option 'weigh_by_kurtosis'
*       which calculates this metric only at the root).
*       When using 'ndim>1', this denotes the probability of choosing columns to create a hyperplane with a
*       probability proportional to the kurtosis of each column within a node.
*       For categorical data, it will calculate the expected kurtosis if the column were converted to
*       numerical by assigning to each category a random number ~ Unif(0, 1).
*       Note that when using sparse matrices, the calculation of kurtosis will rely on a procedure that
*       uses sums of squares and higher-power numbers, which has less numerical precision than the
*       calculation used for dense inputs, and as such, the results might differ slightly.
*       If passing column weights, the effect will be multiplicative. This option is not compatible
*       with 'weigh_by_kurtosis'.
*       If passing a 'missing_action' different than 'fail', infinite values will be ignored for the
*       variance calculation. Otherwise, all columns with infinite values will have the same probability
*       and will be chosen before columns with non-infinite values.
*       If using 'missing_action=Impute', the calculation of kurtosis will not use imputed values
*       in order not to favor columns with missing values (which would increase kurtosis by all having
*       the same central value).
*       Be aware that kurtosis can be a rather slow metric to calculate.
* - min_gain
*       Minimum gain that a split threshold needs to produce in order to proceed with a split.
*       Only used when the splits are decided by a variance gain criterion ('prob_pick_by_gain_pl' or
*       'prob_pick_by_gain_avg', but not 'prob_pick_by_full_gain' nor 'prob_pick_by_dens').
*       If the highest possible gain in the evaluated splits at a node is below this  threshold,
*       that node becomes a terminal node.
*       This can be used as a more sophisticated depth control when using pooled gain (note that 'max_depth'
*       still applies on top of this heuristic).
* - missing_action
*       How to handle missing data at both fitting and prediction time. Options are a) 'Divide' (for the single-variable
*       model only, recommended), which will follow both branches and combine the result with the weight given by the fraction of
*       the data that went to each branch when fitting the model, b) 'Impute', which will assign observations to the
*       branch with the most observations in the single-variable model (but imputed values will also be used for
*       gain calculations), or fill in missing values with the median of each column of the sample from which the
*       split was made in the extended model (recommended) (but note that the calculation of medians does not take 
*       into account sample weights when using 'weights_as_sample_prob=false', and note that when using a gain
*       criterion for splits with 'ndim=1', it will use the imputed values in the calculation), c) 'Fail' which will
*       assume that there are no missing values and will trigger undefined behavior if it encounters any.
*       In the extended model, infinite values will be treated as missing.
*       Note that passing 'Fail' might crash the process if there turn out to be missing values, but will otherwise
*       produce faster fitting and prediction times along with decreased model object sizes.
*       Models from [1], [2], [3], [4] correspond to 'Fail' here.
* - cat_split_type
*       Whether to split categorical features by assigning sub-sets of them to each branch, or by assigning
*       a single category to a branch and the rest to the other branch. For the extended model, whether to
*       give each category a coefficient, or only one while the rest get zero.
* - new_cat_action
*       What to do after splitting a categorical feature when new data that reaches that split has categories that
*       the sub-sample from which the split was done did not have. Options are a) "Weighted" (recommended), which
*       in the single-variable model will follow both branches and combine the result with weight given by the fraction of the
*       data that went to each branch when fitting the model, and in the extended model will assign
*       them the median value for that column that was added to the linear combination of features (but note that
*       this median calculation does not use sample weights when using 'weights_as_sample_prob=false'),
*       b) "Smallest", which will assign all observations with unseen categories in the split to the branch that
*       had fewer observations when fitting the model, c) "Random", which will assign a branch (coefficient in the
*       extended model) at random for each category beforehand, even if no observations had that category when
*       fitting the model. Ignored when passing 'cat_split_type' = 'SingleCateg'.
* - all_perm
*       When doing categorical variable splits by pooled gain with 'ndim=1' (regular model),
*       whether to consider all possible permutations of variables to assign to each branch or not. If 'false',
*       will sort the categories by their frequency and make a grouping in this sorted order. Note that the
*       number of combinations evaluated (if 'true') is the factorial of the number of present categories in
*       a given column (minus 2). For averaged gain, the best split is always to put the second most-frequent
*       category in a separate branch, so not evaluating all  permutations (passing 'false') will make it
*       possible to select other splits that respect the sorted frequency order.
*       The total number of combinations must be a number that can fit into a 'size_t' variable - for x64-64
*       systems, this means no column can have more than 20 different categories if using 'all_perm=true',
*       but note that this is not checked within the function.
*       Ignored when not using categorical variables or not doing splits by pooled gain or using 'ndim>1'.
* - coef_by_prop
*       In the extended model, whether to sort the randomly-generated coefficients for categories
*       according to their relative frequency in the tree node. This might provide better results when using
*       categorical variables with too many categories, but is not recommended, and not reflective of
*       real "categorical-ness". Ignored for the regular model ('ndim=1') and/or when not using categorical
*       variables.
* - imputer (out)
*       Pointer to already-allocated imputer object, which can be used to produce missing value imputations
*       in new data. Pass NULL if no missing value imputations are required. Note that this is not related to
*       'missing_action' as missing values inside the model are treated differently and follow their own imputation
*       or division strategy.
* - min_imp_obs
*       Minimum number of observations with which an imputation value can be produced. Ignored if passing
*       'build_imputer' = 'false'.
* - depth_imp
*       How to weight observations according to their depth when used for imputing missing values. Passing
*       "Higher" will weigh observations higher the further down the tree (away from the root node) the
*       terminal node is, while "lower" will do the opposite, and "Sane" will not modify the weights according
*       to node depth in the tree. Implemented for testing purposes and not recommended to change
*       from the default. Ignored when not passing 'impute_nodes'.
* - weigh_imp_rows
*       How to weight node sizes when used for imputing missing values. Passing "Inverse" will weigh
*       a node inversely proportional to the number of observations that end up there, while "Proportional"
*       will weight them heavier the more observations there are, and "Flat" will weigh all nodes the same
*       in this regard regardless of how many observations end up there. Implemented for testing purposes
*       and not recommended to change from the default. Ignored when not passing 'impute_nodes'.
* - impute_at_fit
*       Whether to impute missing values in the input data as the model is being built. If passing 'true',
*       then 'sample_size' must be equal to 'nrows'. Values in the arrays passed to 'numeric_data',
*       'categ_data', and 'Xc', will get overwritten with the imputations produced.
* - random_seed
*       Seed that will be used to generate random numbers used by the model.
* - use_long_double
*       Whether to use 'long double' (extended precision) type for more precise calculations about
*       standard deviations, means, ratios, weights, gain, and other potential aggregates. This makes
*       such calculations accurate to a larger number of decimals (provided that the compiler used has
*       wider long doubles than doubles) and it is highly recommended to use when the input data has
*       a number of rows or columns exceeding 2^53 (an unlikely scenario), and also highly recommended
*       to use when the input data has problematic scales (e.g. numbers that differ from each other by
*       something like 10^-100 or columns that include values like 10^100 and 10^-100 and still need to
*       be sensitive to a difference of 10^-100), but will make the calculations slower, the more so in
*       platforms in which 'long double' is a software-emulated type (e.g. Power8 platforms).
*       Note that some platforms (most notably windows with the msvc compiler) do not make any difference
*       between 'double' and 'long double'.
* - nthreads
*       Number of parallel threads to use. Note that, the more threads, the more memory will be
*       allocated, even if the thread does not end up being used.
*       Be aware that most of the operations are bound by memory bandwidth, which means that
*       adding more threads will not result in a linear speed-up. For some types of data
*       (e.g. large sparse matrices with small sample sizes), adding more threads might result
*       in only a very modest speed up (e.g. 1.5x faster with 4x more threads),
*       even if all threads look fully utilized.
*       Ignored when not building with OpenMP support.
* 
* Returns
* =======
* Will return macro 'EXIT_SUCCESS' (typically =0) upon completion.
* If the process receives an interrupt signal, will return instead
* 'EXIT_FAILURE' (typically =1). If you do not have any way of determining
* what these values correspond to, you can use the functions
* 'return_EXIT_SUCCESS' and 'return_EXIT_FAILURE', which will return them
* as integers.

/* Add additional trees to already-fitted isolation forest model
* 
* Parameters
* ==========
* - model_outputs
*       Pointer to fitted single-variable model object from function 'fit_iforest'. Pass NULL
*       if the trees are are to be added to an extended model. Can only pass one of
*       'model_outputs' and 'model_outputs_ext'. Note that this function is not thread-safe,
*       so it cannot be run in parallel for the same model object.
* - model_outputs_ext
*       Pointer to fitted extended model object from function 'fit_iforest'. Pass NULL
*       if the trees are are to be added to an single-variable model. Can only pass one of
*       'model_outputs' and 'model_outputs_ext'. Note that this function is not thread-safe,
*       so it cannot be run in parallel for the same model object.
* - numeric_data[nrows * ncols_numeric]
*       Pointer to numeric data to which to fit this additional tree. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no dense numeric columns.
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
*       If the model from 'fit_iforest' was fit to numeric data, must pass numeric data with the same number
*       of columns, either as dense or as sparse arrays.
* - ncols_numeric
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - categ_data[nrows * ncols_categ]
*       Pointer to categorical data to which to fit this additional tree. Must be ordered by columns like Fortran,
*       not ordered by rows like C (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.).
*       Pass NULL if there are no categorical columns. The encoding must be the same as was used
*       in the data to which the model was fit.
*       Each category should be represented as an integer, and these integers must start at zero and
*       be in consecutive order - i.e. if category '3' is present, category '2' must have also been
*       present when the model was fit (note that they are not treated as being ordinal, this is just
*       an encoding). Missing values should be encoded as negative numbers such as (-1). The encoding
*       must be the same as was used in the data to which the model was fit.
*       If the model from 'fit_iforest' was fit to categorical data, must pass categorical data with the same number
*       of columns and the same category encoding.
* - ncols_categ
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - ncat[ncols_categ]
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). May contain new categories,
*       but should keep the same encodings that were used for previous categories.
* - Xc[nnz]
*       Pointer to numeric data in sparse numeric matrix in CSC format (column-compressed).
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
*       Can only pass one of 'numeric_data' or 'Xc' + 'Xc_ind' + 'Xc_indptr'.
* - Xc_ind[nnz]
*       Pointer to row indices to which each non-zero entry in 'Xc' corresponds.
*       Must be in sorted order, otherwise results will be incorrect.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - Xc_indptr[ncols_numeric + 1]
*       Pointer to column index pointers that tell at entry [col] where does column 'col'
*       start and at entry [col + 1] where does column 'col' end.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns.
* - ndim
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Cannot be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - ntry
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - coef_type
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - sample_weights
*       Weights for the rows when adding this tree, either as sampling importances when using
*       sub-samples for each tree (i.e. passing weight '2' makes a row twice as likely to be included
*       in a random sub-sample), or as density measurement (i.e. passing weight '2' is the same as if
*       the row appeared twice, thus it's less of an outlier) - how this is taken is determined
*       through parameter 'weight_as_sample' that was passed to 'fit_iforest.
*       Pass NULL if the rows all have uniform weights.
* - nrows
*       Number of rows in 'numeric_data', 'Xc', 'categ_data'.
* - max_depth
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - ncols_per_tree
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - limit_depth

*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - penalize_range
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - standardize_data

*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - col_weights
*       Sampling weights for each column, assuming all the numeric columns come before the categorical columns.
*       Ignored when picking columns by deterministic criterion.
*       If passing NULL, each column will have a uniform weight. If used along with kurtosis weights, the
*       effect is multiplicative.
* - weigh_by_kurt
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.

* - imputer
*       Pointer to already-allocated imputer object, as it was output from function 'fit_model' while

*       Pass NULL if the model was built without imputer.
* - min_imp_obs
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
* - indexer
*       Indexer object associated to the model object ('model_outputs' or 'model_outputs_ext'), which will
*       be updated with the new tree to add.
*       If 'indexer' has reference points, these must be passed again here in order to index them.
*       Pass NULL if the model has no associated indexer.
* - ref_numeric_data[nref * ncols_numeric]
*       Pointer to numeric data for reference points. May be ordered by rows
*       (i.e. entries 1..n contain row 0, n+1..2n row 1, etc.) - a.k.a. row-major - or by
*       columns (i.e. entries 1..n contain column 0, n+1..2n column 1, etc.) - a.k.a. column-major
*       (see parameter 'ref_is_col_major').
*       Pass NULL if there are no dense numeric columns or no reference points.
*       Can only pass one of 'ref_numeric_data' or 'ref_Xc' + 'ref_Xc_ind' + 'ref_Xc_indptr'.
*       If 'indexer' is passed, it has reference points, and the data to which the model was fit had
*       numeric columns, then numeric data for reference points must be passed (in either dense or sparse format).

*       If 'indexer' is passed, it has reference points, and the data to which the model was fit had
*       categorical columns, then 'ref_categ_data' must be passed.
* - ref_is_col_major
*       Whether 'ref_numeric_data' and/or 'ref_categ_data' are in column-major order. If numeric data is
*       passed in sparse format, categorical data must be passed in column-major format. If passing dense
*       data, row-major format is preferred as it will be faster. If the data is passed in row-major format,
*       must also pass 'ref_ld_numeric' and/or 'ref_ld_categ'.
*       If both 'ref_numeric_data' and 'ref_categ_data' are passed, they must have the same orientation
*       (row-major or column-major).
* - ref_ld_numeric
*       Leading dimension of the array 'ref_numeric_data', if it is passed in row-major format.
*       Typically, this corresponds to the number of columns, but may be larger (the array will
*       be accessed assuming that row 'n' starts at 'ref_numeric_data + n*ref_ld_numeric'). If passing
*       'ref_numeric_data' in column-major order, this is ignored and will be assumed that the
*       leading dimension corresponds to the number of rows. This is ignored when passing numeric
*       data in sparse format.
* - ref_ld_categ
*       Leading dimension of the array 'ref_categ_data', if it is passed in row-major format.
*       Typically, this corresponds to the number of columns, but may be larger (the array will
*       be accessed assuming that row 'n' starts at 'ref_categ_data + n*ref_ld_categ'). If passing
*       'ref_categ_data' in column-major order, this is ignored and will be assumed that the
*       leading dimension corresponds to the number of rows.
* - ref_Xc[ref_nnz]
*       Pointer to numeric data for reference points in sparse numeric matrix in CSC format (column-compressed).
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns for reference points or no reference points.
*       Can only pass one of 'ref_numeric_data' or 'ref_Xc' + 'ref_Xc_ind' + 'ref_Xc_indptr'.
* - ref_Xc_ind[ref_nnz]
*       Pointer to row indices to which each non-zero entry in 'ref_Xc' corresponds.
*       Must be in sorted order, otherwise results will be incorrect.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns in CSC format for reference points or no reference points.
* - ref_Xc_indptr[ref_nnz]
*       Pointer to column index pointers that tell at entry [col] where does column 'col'
*       start and at entry [col + 1] where does column 'col' end.
*       Pass NULL if there are no sparse numeric columns in CSC format for reference points or no reference points.
* - random_seed
*       Seed that will be used to generate random numbers used by the model.
* - use_long_double
*       Same parameter as for 'fit_iforest' (see the documentation in there for details). Can be changed from
*       what was originally passed to 'fit_iforest'.
