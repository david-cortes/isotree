/* Append trees from one model into another
* 
* Parameters
* ==========
* - model (in, out)
*       Pointer to isolation forest model which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest'.
*       The trees from 'other' will be merged into this (will be at the end of vector member 'trees').
*       Both 'model' and 'other' must have been fit with the same hyperparameters
*       in order for this merge to work correctly - at the very least, should have
*       the same 'missing_action', 'cat_split_type', 'new_cat_action'.
*       Should only pass one of 'model'+'other' or 'ext_model'+'ext_other'.
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - other
*       Pointer to isolation forest model which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest'.
*       The trees from this object will be added into 'model' (this object will not be modified).
*       Both 'model' and 'other' must have been fit with the same hyperparameters
*       in order for this merge to work correctly - at the very least, should have
*       the same 'missing_action', 'cat_split_type', 'new_cat_action'.
*       Should only pass one of 'model'+'other' or 'ext_model'+'ext_other'.
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - ext_model (in, out)
*       Pointer to extended isolation forest model which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest'.
*       The trees/hyperplanes from 'ext_other' will be merged into this (will be at the end of vector member 'hplanes').
*       Both 'ext_model' and 'ext_other' must have been fit with the same hyperparameters
*       in order for this merge to work correctly - at the very least, should have
*       the same 'missing_action', 'cat_split_type', 'new_cat_action'.
*       Should only pass one of 'model'+'other' or 'ext_model'+'ext_other'.
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - ext_other
*       Pointer to extended isolation forest model which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest'.
*       The trees/hyperplanes from this object will be added into 'ext_model' (this object will not be modified).
*       Both 'ext_model' and 'ext_other' must have been fit with the same hyperparameters
*       in order for this merge to work correctly - at the very least, should have
*       the same 'missing_action', 'cat_split_type', 'new_cat_action'.
*       Should only pass one of 'model'+'other' or 'ext_model'+'ext_other'.
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - imputer (in, out)
*       Pointer to imputation object which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest' along with
*       either 'model' or 'ext_model' in the same call to 'fit_iforest'.
*       The imputation nodes from 'iother' will be merged into this (will be at the end of vector member 'imputer_tree').
*       Hyperparameters related to imputation might differ between 'imputer' and 'iother' ('imputer' will preserve its
*       hyperparameters after the merge).
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - iother
*       Pointer to imputation object which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest' along with
*       either 'model' or 'ext_model' in the same call to 'fit_iforest'.
*       The imputation nodes from this object will be added into 'imputer' (this object will not be modified).
*       Hyperparameters related to imputation might differ between 'imputer' and 'iother' ('imputer' will preserve its
*       hyperparameters after the merge).
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - indexer (in, out)
*       Pointer to indexer object which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest' along with
*       either 'model' or 'ext_model' in the same call to 'fit_iforest' or through another specialized function.
*       The imputation nodes from 'ind_other' will be merged into this (will be at the end of vector member 'indices').
*       Reference points should not differ between 'indexer' and 'ind_other'.
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
* - ind_other
*       Pointer to indexer object which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest' along with
*       either 'model' or 'ext_model' in the same call to 'fit_iforest' or through another specialized function.
*       The imputation nodes from this object will be added into 'imputer' (this object will not be modified).
*       Reference points should not differ between 'indexer' and 'ind_other'.
*       Pass NULL if this is not to be used.
