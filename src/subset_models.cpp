/* Create a model containing a sub-set of the trees from another model
* 
* Parameters
* ==========
* - model (in)
*       Pointer to isolation forest model which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest',
*       from which the desired trees will be copied into a new model object.
*       Pass NULL if using the extended model.
* - ext_model (in)
*       Pointer to extended isolation forest model which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest',
*       from which the desired trees will be copied into a new model object.
*       Pass NULL if using the single-variable model.
* - imputer (in)
*       Pointer to imputation object which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest' along with
*       either 'model' or 'ext_model' in the same call to 'fit_iforest'.
*       Pass NULL if the model was built without an imputer.
* - indexer (in)
*       Pointer to indexer object which has already been fit through 'fit_iforest' along with
*       either 'model' or 'ext_model' in the same call to 'fit_iforest' or through another specialized funcction.
*       Pass NULL if the model was built without an indexer.
* - model_new (out)
*       Pointer to already-allocated isolation forest model, which will be reset and to
*       which the selected trees from 'model' will be copied.
*       Pass NULL if using the extended model.
* - ext_model_new (out)
*       Pointer to already-allocated extended isolation forest model, which will be reset and to
*       which the selected hyperplanes from 'ext_model' will be copied.
*       Pass NULL if using the single-variable model.
* - imputer_new (out)
*       Pointer to already-allocated imputation object, which will be reset and to
*       which the selected nodes from 'imputer' (matching to those of either 'model'
*       or 'ext_model') will be copied.
*       Pass NULL if the model was built without an imputer.
* - indexer_new (out)
*       Pointer to already-allocated indexer object, which will be reset and to
*       which the selected nodes from 'indexer' (matching to those of either 'model'
*       or 'ext_model') will be copied.
*       Pass NULL if the model was built without an indexer.
